Although he long tried to get both countries to adopt a closer political union, the kingdoms of Scotland and England remained individual sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, both ruled by James in personal union.. James was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, and thus a potential successor to all three thrones. He succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother was compelled to abdicate in his favour. Four different regents governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583.

Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.. Climate change is causing a range of increasing impacts on the environment.

Observation 1: The Winter's Tale is a play by William Shakespeare originally published in the First Folio of 1623. Although it was grouped among the comedies,[1] many modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances. Some critics consider it to be one of Shakespeare's "problem plays" because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comic and supply a happy ending.[2]. The play has been intermittently popular, revived in productions in various forms and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners in Shakespearean performance history, beginning after a long interval with David Garrick in his adaptation Florizel and Perdita (first performed in 1753 and published in 1756). The Winter's Tale was revived again in the 19th century, when the fourth "pastoral" act was widely popular.

Daggering is not a traditional dance; it is of recent origin, associated with the 2006 wave of dancehall music.[citation needed]. The activity of "daggering" has been present in Jamaica's dancehalls for many years, but only recently has the term "daggering" been used as a description. Some argue that it is roughly the equivalent of the Caribbean’s "cabin stabbing", another style of music and dance.[1] Mojo magazine journalist and reggae historian David Katz attributes the recent popularity of daggering to a series of dancehall music videos and artists that promoted the style. YouTube videos of people performing daggering have spread the trend worldwide.[citation needed].

Observation 1: Ian Fraser Kilmister (24 December 1945 – 28 December 2015), better known as Lemmy Kilmister or simply Lemmy, was an English musician. He was the founder, lead singer, bassist and primary songwriter of the rock band Motörhead, of which he was the only continuous member, and a member of Hawkwind from 1971 to 1975.. A foundational force in the genre following the advent of the new wave of British heavy metal, Lemmy was known for his appearance, which included his signature friendly mutton chops, his military-influenced fashion sense and his gravelly rasp of a voice. It was once declared "one of the most recognisable voices in rock".[1] He was also noted for his unique way of singing, which was once described as "looking up towards a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face".[2] He was also known for his bass playing style and using his Rickenbacker bass to create an "overpowered, distorted rhythmic rumble".[2] Another notable aspect of his bass sound was his guitar-like riffing, which included using a pick, and often played power chords using heavily overdriven tube stacks by Marshall.. Lemmy was born in Stoke-on-Trent and grew up between there, the nearby towns of Newcastle-under-Lyme and Madeley, and later the Welsh village of Benllech, Anglesey.

Thought 2: The observation says that Lemmy was known for his "gravelly rasp of a voice" and that it was "one of the most recognisable voices in rock". This supports the claim that Lemmy was known for his distinct gravelly voice.

With a raspy voice and a stage show that features numerous props and stage illusions, including pyrotechnics, guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, reptiles, baby dolls, and dueling swords,[2] Cooper is considered by many music journalists and peers to be "The Godfather of Shock Rock".[3] He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock audiences.[4]. Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, "Alice Cooper" was originally a band with roots extending back to a band called the Earwigs, consisting of Furnier on lead vocals and harmonica, Glen Buxton on lead guitar, and Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar and backing vocals. By 1966, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar joined the three and Neal Smith was added on drums in 1967. The five named the band "Alice Cooper", and Furnier eventually adopted it as his stage pseudonym.[5][6] They released their 1969 debut studio album with limited chart success.

Observation 1: The Winter's Tale is a play by William Shakespeare originally published in the First Folio of 1623. Although it was grouped among the comedies,[1] many modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances. Some critics consider it to be one of Shakespeare's "problem plays" because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comic and supply a happy ending.[2]. The play has been intermittently popular, revived in productions in various forms and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners in Shakespearean performance history, beginning after a long interval with David Garrick in his adaptation Florizel and Perdita (first performed in 1753 and published in 1756). The Winter's Tale was revived again in the 19th century, when the fourth "pastoral" act was widely popular.

4097 Claim: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a disease that usually starts around the age of 60.
Thought 1: I should search for information about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and find out when it usually starts.
Action 1: Search[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]
Observation 1: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rare and terminal neurodegenerative disease that results in the progressive loss of motor neurons that control voluntary muscles.[3] ALS is the most common form of the motor neuron diseases.[8] Early symptoms of ALS include stiff muscles, muscle twitches, gradual increasing weakness, and muscle wasting.[3] Limb-onset ALS begins with weakness in the arms or legs, while bulbar-onset ALS begins with difficulty in speaking or swallowing.[9] Around half of people with ALS develop at least mild difficulties with thinking and behavior, and about 15% develop frontotemporal dementia.[10] Motor neuron loss continues until the abilities to eat, speak, move, or, lastly, breathe are lost.[3]. Most cases of ALS (about 90% to 95%) have no known cause, and are known as sporadic ALS.[3][11] However, both genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved.[12] The remaining 5% to 10% of cases have a genetic cause, often linked to a history of the disease in the family, and these are known as familial ALS (hereditary).[6][13] About half of these genetic cases are due to disease-causing variants in one of four specific genes.[14] The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing conducted to rule out other potential causes.[3]. There is no known cure for ALS.[3] The goal of treatment is to slow the disease progression, and improve symptoms.[10] Treatments that slow ALS include riluzole (extends life by two to three months) and sodium phenylbutyrate/ursodoxicoltaurine (extends life by around seven months).[15][16] Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality, and length of life.[5] Mechanical ventilation can prolong survival but does not stop disease progression.[17] A feeding tube may help maintain weight and nutrition.[18] Death is usually caused by respiratory failure.[19] The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60.[19] The average survival from onset to death is two to four years, though this can vary, and about 10% of those affected survive longer than ten years.[20]. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[21] In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[21]. ALS is a motor neuron disease, which is a group of neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body.[3] Other motor neuron diseases include primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), progressive bulbar palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and monomelic amyotrophy (MMA).[22].

Thought 2: The observation states that "the disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60." This supports the claim that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis usually starts around the age of 60.

Action 1: Search[Brazzers]
Observation 1: Brazzers (/ˈbræzərz/, company name: MG Premium Ltd.) is a Canadian pornographic video production company with headquarters in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and legal domicile in Nicosia, Cyprus. With an online network consisting of thirty-one hardcore pornography websites, the company's slogan is "World's Best HD Porn Site!".[2] The site contains 10,036 videos, which were published by 33 different sites (December 2020).[2][3] Their network of sites features 2,340 pornstar models (December 2020).[3]. Founded in 2005 by a group of Montreal investors, Brazzers became part of a larger group of pornographic sites under the corporate name of Mansef. In 2010, Mansef was sold to Fabian Thylmann and rebranded as Manwin Inc.[4][5] In December 2012, Thylmann was extradited from Belgium to Germany on suspicion of tax evasion.[6]. In October 2013, Thylmann sold Manwin's assets, including Brazzers, to an internal management group, Mindgeek.[7].

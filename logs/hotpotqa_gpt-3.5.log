Thought 1: I need to find out what objects were carried into battle by naval ships for which the QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss were introduced to defend against.

There were many variants produced, often under license which ranged in length from 40 to 58 calibers, but 40 caliber was the most common version.. 6-pounders were widely used by the navies of a number of nations and often used by both sides in a conflict. Due to advances in torpedo delivery and performance, 6-pounder guns were rapidly made obsolete and were replaced with larger guns aboard most larger warships. This led to their being used ashore during World War I as coastal defense guns, the first tank guns and as anti-aircraft guns, whether on improvised or specialized HA/LA mounts.

Thought 2: The QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns were introduced to defend against new, small, and fast vessels such as torpedo boats and submarines.

Manaslu was first climbed on May 9, 1956, by Toshio Imanishi and Gyalzen Norbu, members of a Japanese expedition. It is said that, given the many unsuccessful attempts by the British to climb Everest before Nepali Tenzing Norgay and New Zealander Edmund Hillary, "just as the British consider Everest their mountain, Manaslu has always been a Japanese mountain".[4][5].

Shispare lies east of the Batura Wall, which is the highest part of the Batura Muztagh in Pakistan..

Despite its top 20 height, Ngadi Chuli has only been climbed once or twice. The probable first ascent occurred in 1970, when Hiroshi Watanabe and Sherpa Lhakpa Tsering, members of a Japanese expedition, climbed the east ridge and face.

Sports Illustrated described the rivalry as the oldest (Division I) rivalry west of the Mississippi River in 2011,[3] but went dormant after Missouri departed the Big 12 Conference for the Southeastern Conference on July 1, 2012. Despite Missouri wanting to continue athletic competition, no further regular season games were scheduled between the two schools for several years.[4] However, the two schools played an exhibition game in men's basketball on October 22, 2017, with Kansas defeating Missouri 93–87. Proceeds went to four different charities for Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Maria relief funds.[5] On October 21, 2019, the schools agreed to play six basketball games beginning in 2020,[6] however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the renewal was postponed one season.[7] Then, on May 2, the schools made an agreement for football games to be played in 2025, 2026, 2031, and 2032.[8] On December 11, 2021, the rivalry was renewed in Allen Fieldhouse, when the Jayhawks beat the Tigers 102-65.[9].

Thought 1: I need to search Gilliam-class attack transports, find the Navy that had them, and then find the number of personnel on active duty.
Action 1: Search[Gilliam-class attack transports]
Observation 1: The Gilliam-class attack transport was a class of attack transport built for service with the US Navy in World War II.. Like all attack transports, the purpose of the Gilliams was to transport troops and equipment to foreign shores in order to execute amphibious invasions using an array of smaller amphibious assault boats carried by the attack transport itself. The Gilliam-class was heavily armed with antiaircraft weaponry to protect itself and its cargo of troops from air attack in the battle zone.. The Gilliam-class was designed by San Francisco naval architects Joslyn & Ryan and designated by the Maritime Commission (MARCOM) as type S4-SE2-BD1. The Gilliams were significantly smaller, both in size and displacement, than other classes of attack transports.

Thought 2: The passage does not mention the Navy that had Gilliam-class attack transports. I need to look up Gilliam-class attack transports and find the Navy that had them.

Thought 1: I need to search John O'Hara and Rabindranath Tagore, find their nationalities, then find if they are the same.
Action 1: Search[John O'Hara]
Observation 1: John Henry O'Hara (January 31, 1905 – April 11, 1970) was one of America's most prolific writers of short stories, credited with helping to invent The New Yorker magazine short story style.[1] He became a best-selling novelist before the age of 30 with Appointment in Samarra and BUtterfield 8. While O'Hara's legacy as a writer is debated, his champions rank him highly among the under-appreciated and unjustly neglected major American writers of the 20th century.[2] Few college students educated after O'Hara's death in 1970 have discovered him, chiefly because he refused to allow his work to be reprinted in anthologies used to teach literature at the college level.. "O’Hara may not have been the best story writer of the twentieth century, but he is the most addictive," wrote Lorin Stein, then editor-in-chief of the Paris Review, in a 2013 appreciation of O'Hara's work. Stein added, "You can binge on his collections the way some people binge on Mad Men, and for some of the same reasons. On the topics of class, sex, and alcohol—that is, the topics that mattered to him—his novels amount to a secret history of American life."[3] His work stands out from that of his contemporary authors for its unvarnished realism.[citation needed].

Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of Gitanjali,[7] he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.[8] Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical poetry were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent.[9] He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as "the Bard of Bengal",[10][5][6] Tagore was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.[a]. A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district[12] and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.[13] At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.[14] By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent critic of nationalism,[15] he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain.

Bison (redirect from Vega (Dictator))'].

Thought 2: I couldn't find the man who developed the dictator game. Maybe I can try searching for the dictator game itself and find the information from there.
Action 2: Search[dictator game]
Observation 2: The dictator game is a popular experimental instrument in social psychology and economics,[1] a derivative of the ultimatum game. The term "game" is a misnomer because it captures a decision by a single player: to send money to another or not.[2] Thus, the dictator has the most power and holds the preferred position in this “game.” Although the “dictator” has the most power and presents a take it or leave it offer, the game has mixed results based on different behavioral attributes.[3] The results – where most "dictators" choose to send money – evidence the role of fairness and norms in economic behavior, and undermine the assumption of narrow self-interest when given the opportunity to maximise one's own profits.[4]. The dictator game is a derivative of the ultimatum game, in which one player (the proposer) provides a one-time offer to the other (the responder). The responder can choose to either accept or reject the proposer's bid, but rejecting the bid would result in both players receiving a payoff of 0. In the dictator game, the first player, "the dictator", determines how to split an endowment (such as a cash prize) between themselves and the second player[5] (the recipient).

This esteemed roster includes Martha Nelson (1993-2002), Charla Lawhon (2002-2008), Ariel Foxman (2008-2016), and Laura Brown (2017-2022)..

Initially called Executioner, the band changed its name to Xecutioner in 1986 to avoid confusion with the thrash metal band Executioner from Boston, and then changed its name once again to Obituary in 1988.

Stza was raised in New York by his mother, who he classified as an "over-protective Jewish mom". He rarely saw his biological father, and his stepfather died by suicide.[2] As a teenager, he dropped out of high school, ran away from home, and began riding freight trains.[3] During this time, he began using heroin and crack cocaine. He later described drugs as a positive influence in his life and said that he would have killed himself during this time if not for drugs because he was "very lonely and suicidal."[4]. In 1990, Stza and a friend of his, Alec Baillie, formed No Commercial Value, which later evolved into Choking Victim and then again into Leftöver Crack.
